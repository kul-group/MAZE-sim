Background
====================================================================
Zeolites are microporous materials integral to the modern world. Their roles include (but are not limited to) gas separators and catalysts. The structure of a zeolite determines its viability for industrial applications, and searching for optimal zeolite structures for specific applications is complicated by the vastness of the zeolite chemical space. [maybe insert something about what the chemical space is, how to change a structure, etc] Currently, over 245 unique zeolites have been synthesized, which is  minor compared to the one million theoretical zeolites that have been identified. Synthesizing zeolites is time consuming, challenging and not always reproducible indicating synthesis of millions of zeolites is not feasible. Thus, it is essential for zeolite structures to be computationally screened for their industrial potentials before attempts at their syntheses in labs are made.

The Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) is a set of tools that facilitates calculations to determine zeolite potentials. It offers an object-oriented interface to represent individual and groups of atoms and calculators. Additionally, ASE supports exporting to formats that are compatible with [need to do more work to figure out!!]...  Many successful zeolite screening projects have been carried out with this software to date.
