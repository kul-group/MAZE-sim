Background
====================================================================
Zeolites are microporous materials with many industrial uses ranging from gas separation, to catalysts. Over 245 unique zeolite frameworks have been synthesized, and over a million “theoretical zeolites” crystal structures have been identified, but have yet to be synthesized. Increasing the zeolite chemical spaces further are the wide variety of chemical variation among a single zeolite framework. Zeolite can be altered by the addition of cations, metals and other non-Si components. The Al/Si ratio can also be varied, changing the distribution of T sites in the zeolite. The vastness of the zeolite chemical space makes exploring it through lab style experiments impossible. 

Chemical simulation experiments, allow the rapid screening of both synthesized and theoretical zeolites for their chemical properties. The Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) facilitates these calculations by offering an object-oriented interface to represent individual and groups of atoms, and calculators. It also supports exporting to formats that are compatable with   The Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) is a set of tools useful for setting up atomic simulations. Many successful zeolite screening projects have been carried out with this software.
